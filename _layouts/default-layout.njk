                <p>I'm a born and raised Vermonter, currently in my junior year at the <span>University of Vermont</span> where I'm studying political science and French. After class, I can be found at practice with the Lawrence Debate Union or representing UVM's chapter of the Yale-founded, "<span>Every Vote Counts</span>."  Problem solving to help folks is important to me.</p>
                <p>In the way of programming, web-development has really taken my heart; that anyone can easily deploy code without special requisites for the user blows my mind. Particularly, I'm interested in working with the <span>JAMstack</span> and focusing on user experience.</p>
                <p>If you'd like to make something happen, definitely <span>reach out!</span></p>
