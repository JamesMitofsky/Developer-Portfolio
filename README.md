## Installing / Getting Started

This project requires NPM; install it by [following these directions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Then run this script to install all packages and start a local server.

```
npm i && npm run serve
```

## Technologies

### MX Improv — Email

Create email addresses matching the domain using [Improv MX](https://improvmx.com). This allows for receiving from any address type, but can also permit sending if [integrated with Gmail](https://improvmx.com/guides/send-emails-using-gmail/).

### Netlify Forms

Use [Netlify form submissions](http://xahlee.info) for collecting user responses.

### Eleventy — SSG

Use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) for building a Statically Generated Site.

### Nunjucks — Templating

[Find the docs here.](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) Nunjucks aren't required by Eleventy, but they're my preferred templating language.

I enjoyed reading [this article](https://css-tricks.com/killer-features-of-nunjucks/) by CSS Tricks for a few quick tips.
